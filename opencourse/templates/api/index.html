      <p>
        The "Open" in Open Course Project means devotion to free information and
        Open Source technologies. The data that is compiled to service
        this website is regularly extracted directly from various CNU websites,
        but it's provided centrally using RESTful API standards to any
        interested students or third parties.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you are creating your own service or even a personal application
        using course, term, or instructor data, you are welcomed to use the API
        detailed on this page.
        General API endpoints are keyless and anonymous for now. If you're
        interested in using it for your projects, please don't abuse it.
        Otherwise I'll have to buy a bike lock.

    </div>
    <div class="panel-body">
      <ul>
        <li>
          All queries should be directed to the API URL:
          <code>https://opencourseproject.com/api/v1/</code>
        </li>
        <li>
          API queries can be returned in your choice of
          <code>json</code>, <code>xml</code>, or <code>yaml</code> format.
          To specify, use the <code>Accept</code> header in your GET
          request:
          <pre>curl -H "Accept: application/json" https://opencourseproject.com/api/v1/course/</pre>
          Alternatively, you may append <code>?format=json</code> to the end
          of the url.
        </li>
        <li>
          Large sets of data will be paginated with a limit of 20 objects per
          page. Each result will contain a <code>meta</code> object which has
          <code>limit</code> and a <code>next</code> URI which you may navigate
          to in order to get to the next page of data.
        </li>
        <li>
          To avoid pagination, you can append <code>?limit=0</code> to the end
          of the url. It is requested that you avoid this unless absolutely
          necessary to avoid large I/O spikes. When possible, use filters so
          that your queries don't result in data sets needing to be paginated
          in the first place.
        </li>
        <li>
          To filter objects, use field names in the query. For instance,
          <code>https://opencourseproject.com/api/v1/course/?days=MWF</code>
          finds all courses which meet Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. You
          can further filter objects, for instance
          <code>https://opencourseproject.com/api/v1/course/?days=MWF&meeting_times__start_time=10:00:00</code>
          finds all courses which meet Monday, Wednesday, and Friday at 10am.
        </li>
        <li>
          See the endpoint details for information about which fields you can
          use to filter your queries. If you'd like to filter on a sub-object,
          you can use the <code>__</code> (double underscore) accessor.
          For instance, <code>https://opencourseproject.com/api/v1/course/?instructor__rmp_score=3</code>
          finds all courses where the instructor's RateMyProfessor score is 3.0.
        </li>
        <li>
          You can use <code>__gt</code> (greater than), <code>__lt</code> (less than),
          <code>__contains</code>, <code>__startswith</code> or <code>__endswith</code>
          modifiers to make advanced queries.
          For instance, <code>https://opencourseproject.com/api/v1/course/?instructor__rmp_score__gt=3</code>
          finds all courses where the instructor's RateMyProfessor score is 3.0
          <strong>or higher</strong>.
        </li>
      </ul>
