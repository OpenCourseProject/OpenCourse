            The Open Course Project is an <a href="http://opensource.org/">Open Source</a>
            system designed to improve many aspects of course registration and lookup
            at Christopher Newport University.
          </p>
          <p>
            Source code for this website is hosted at <a href="http://github.com/gravitylow/OpenCourse">github.com/gravitylow/OpenCourse</a>.
            If you're interested in contributing to the project by submitting code,
            filing bug reports, or suggesting improvements, your support is greatly
            appreciated!
          </p>

						Through official University locations such as CNU Live and Schedule of
						Courses as well as third-party websites such as RateMyProfessor, Amazon,
						Chegg, and others, there are many different sources students use to plan
						their schedules each semester. The goal of this website is to provide a
						centralized location for all course-related information at CNU, merging
						data from all these sources into a single, beautiful website that meets
						today's Internet standards.
					</p>
					<p>
						CNU has done a great job with their registration services. There are no
						glaring issues that exist that constantly cause problems for students.
						The systems that power these sites are clearly well-kept, and the school
						is to be commended for this. OpenCourse is not here to replace or to "fix"
						any problems whatsoever. The goal of the project is to make small changes,
						present data in a more user-friendly way, and to offer additional methods
						of browsing and planning.
					</p>
					<p>
						With this in mind, a lot of careful development has been done to ensure
						that these two distinct systems stay seperate. This website does not
						offer <strong>any</strong> registration services nor does it attempt to
						subvert or replace any functionality of CNU Live. Because data is
						automatically scraped from various sources to populate this website, it
						could be temporarily out of date at any time. Furthermore, there's no
						budget for this project; everything that you see is volunteer work.
						There is always the possibility that something breaks and isn't noticed.
						Please use this resource for its intended purpose: planning, researching,
						and as a supplement to official University systems. Do not entrust your
						semester to any one non-CNU website, ever.

            If you're just starting on OpenCourse, you'll probably want to sync
            your current schedule from CNU Live instead of manually adding all
            the classes.
          </p>
          <p>
            Fortunately, this is made easy by the official
            <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/iklkhbogomjhkakapieafljbldmhelep">Google Chrome</a>
						and <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/open-course/">Firefox</a> plugins
            which integrate with your schedule on CNU Live. You'll want to add
            it to your browser here:
          </p>
          <button class="btn btn-info" onclick="chrome.webstore.install()" id="install-button">Install Chrome plugin</button>
					<a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/open-course/" target="_blank"><button class="btn btn-success">Install Firefox addon</button></a>
          <br><br>
          {% if not request.user.is_authenticated %}
          <p class="text-danger">
            Make sure you <a href="/account/">log in</a> before you try to sync
						your courses.
          </p>
          {% endif %}
          <p class="bg-info">
            If you're not using Google Chrome or Firefox, you can still use this site.
            Instead of syncing courses from CNU Live, you should use the <a href="/search/">search</a>
            function to find your courses, open them up, and hit the "Add to schedule" button.
          </p>
          <p>
            Once you've got the plugin installed, you can head to <a href="https://luna.cnu.edu/sso/SSO/SSO_CNU_Live.aspx">CNU Live</a>
            and go to <strong>Student Services</strong>, to <strong>Registration</strong>,
            and then click <strong>Student Detail Schedule</strong>. Select the
            term you're interested in syncing to OpenCourse, and then hit submit.
          </p>
          <p>
            If the plugin has been installed correctly, you should see a large
            green button linking you to the matching OpenCourse schedule as well
            as green check marks or red X's depending on whether or not the
            course listed is included on your OpenCourse schedule. If you don't
            see any of these things, feel free to <a href="mailto:ad@mfendley.com" target="_top">contact me</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you see a green check mark, it means the course that is displayed
            on your registration is properly synced - you're good to go! If you
            see a red X, it means the course isn't on your schedule yet, so you
            should probably add it. To do this easily you can click the blue
            "Add" button that will appear there and the course will be synced.
            Do this for all the courses until only green checks appear!
          </p>
          <p>
            After everything is synced, you can click the green button to view
            your schedule back here. You should see a nice listing of your
            courses as well as a calendar view option to see them listed by time.
            You can also make use of the share URL or the Facebook share widget
            to share your schedule with whoever you like!
          </p>
          <p>
            Remember that if you make changes to your schedule on OpenCourse, it
            has no change on your official registration. Scheduling on this site
            is purely for planning, sharing, and research. Enjoy!

				<div class="panel-body">
					<p>
						When using a third-party system such as this one, privacy of your
						personal information is an important topic.
					</p>
					<strong>Personal Information</strong>
					<p>
						We believe that no more data than absolutely necessary should be
						collected at all, a reason you would never be asked for your student ID
						or anything similar. The following is the only personal information is
						collected by using this site:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Email address
							<ul>
								<li>
									This information is used to identify your account on the site.
									Logging in with your CNU-provided Google account is an easier
									process than creating a new account specifically for this website,
									so it is used as a means of identification.
								</li>
								<li>
									You will only recieve email communications from using this site
									if you choose to opt-in to updates about a course or if an
									important announcement needs to be made, though this is rare.
									Additionally, if you report a bug or suggest an improvement we
									might follow-up with you via email.
								</li>
								<li>
									Your email address is never shared.
								</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>First and Last name
							<ul>
								<li>
									This information is included in your email address and is used
									to personalize information on site pages, especially on your
									schedule that you share with others.
								</li>
								<li>
									Name information is reported by your Google account and can be
									changed by editing your personal information on the Google
									account page.
								</li>
								<li>
									Your name is only shared with those who you send your schedule.
								</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
					</ul>
					<strong>User Content</strong>
					<p>
						Content can also be provided by you to improve your experience. This
						could include adding your Learning Community for display on your
						schedule, inputting your courses for a term, linking your Facebook
						account to show friends in your classes, and so on.
					</p>
					<p>
						This content is shared at your discretion, and you control how it
						is sent. Your content, while not considered "secret" by man, is still
						"private" and should be kept that way. Content you provide is only
						viewed as necessary to fix problems with or improve the service,
						especially when reported by a user. In some cases to improve the
						service this content may be analyzed on an anonymized basis, such as
						counting how many courses have been scheduled by all users on the
						site to determine if the database needs to be upgraded.
					</p>
					<strong>Automatic Information</strong>
					<p>
						In addition to information related to your account, there is a minor
						amount of data that is automatically generated when you use the service.
						This specifically includes log files, which are generated by the web
						server to keep track of pages which are visited and errors that occur.
						Log files contain records such as the web request, IP
						(Internet Protocol) address it is sent from, browser type, and
						similar information.
					</p>
					<p>
						Analyzing these files helps to understand the popularity of certain
						features as well as where problems are occuring for users. These files
						are never shared with anyone and are archived after several days.

						Security is one of the most important goals of this project. Not all
						people are concerned about the privacy of their schedule information,
						but for those who are it's been made a priority. Here are some details
						of what has been done to protect personal information:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<strong>No accounts are created on this site.</strong> When you login
							with your CNU account, you are using Google's OAuth systems which give
							information about your account, like your email address, to the site
							but never your password or any other personal information from CNU Live.
							Logging in with your CNU account to this site does not give it access
							to act on your behalf in any way.
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>The site is encrypted with an industry-standard certificate.</strong>
							The lock icon in the upper left-hand corner of your URL bar will confirm
							that this site is using SSL/TLS to restrict visibility to you and only
							you. The information that you enter on this site and any data you get
							back is unreadable even to eavesdroppers. The certificate used has an
							<a href="https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/analyze.html?d=opencourseproject.com&s=104.18.51.176">A rating on SSL Labs</a>.
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Any personal information provided by API requires a secret key.</strong>
							If you're a developer using the <a href="/api/">API</a>, you will already
							know that aside from general, open data (such as course listings, term
							details, professor scores, etc.), a private and unique key is required
							to read or write. For the non-developer, this means that even at the
							most barebones level of data retrieval, your schedules are visible only
							to your account and cannot be accessed through the database without
							your explicit permission.
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>The source code is open.</strong> Aside from private keys used
							to communicate with third-parties such as Google and Facebook, none of
							the code that runs this website is proprietary. If you come across a
							vulnerability or a problem in the code that has security implications,
							please <a href="mailto:ad@mfendley.com" target="_top">email me</a>.

            Though the goal of this project focuses completely on CNU, the framework
            that has been created could apply to many universities. In order to
            populate the site with information from a different source, the custom
            management commands would need to be rewired to fetch from another location.
            Some other discrepancies could exist in how courses are labled, but a lot
            of the work is written to be generic.
