# Open Course Project

The Open Course Project is an effort to overhaul course lookup and registration. On Open Course you can:
* Search and view courses by any criteria
* See your exam schedule
* Find Facebook friends in your classes
* See instructor details, including their RateMyProfessor scores
* Create and share semester schedules
* Follow courses and get updates on their status

## Usage

This repository is a [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) project written in Python.

The official Open Course Project website is online at https://opencourseproject.com.
This website and the code on this branch is geared towards usage at Christopher Newport University.

If you'd like to setup the system for yourself, please see [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md).

For necessary privacy, details of the settings files necessary to run a Django project have been scrubbed from
public viewing. Where that has been done, notes have been made in the file to allow anyone to reconstruct and easily start the site themselves. No other essential files have been removed.
