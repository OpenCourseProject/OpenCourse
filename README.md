# Open Course Project

The Open Course Project is an effort to overhaul course lookup and registration. On Open Course you can:
* Search and view courses by any criteria
* See your exam schedule
* Find Facebook friends in your classes
* See instructor details, including their RateMyProfessor scores
* Create and share semester schedules
* Follow courses and get updates on their status

## Usage

This repository is a [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) project written in Python.

The official Open Course Project website is online at https://opencourseproject.com.
This website and project are still in heavy development, and the code at this repository should be up-to-date,
but may not necessarily reflect the current state of the website.

For necessary privacy, details of the settings.py file necessary to run a Django project have been scrubbed from
public viewing. Where that has been done, notes have been made in the file to allow anyone to reconstruct and easily
start the site themselves. No other essential files have been removed.

4. Commit your changes: `git commit -am 'Add some feature'`
