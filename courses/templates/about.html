        The Open Course Project is an <a href="http://opensource.org/">Open Source</a>
        system designed to improve many aspects of course registration and lookup
        at Christopher Newport University.

        Source code for this website is hosted at <a href="http://github.com/gravitylow/OpenCourse">github.com/gravitylow/OpenCourse</a>.
        If you're interested in contributing to the project by submitting code,
        filing bug reports, or suggesting improvements, your support is greatly
        appreciated!

        Through official University locations such as CNU Live and Schedule of
        Courses as well as third-party websites such as RateMyProfessor, Amazon,
        Chegg, and others, there are many different sources students use to plan
        their schedules each semester. The goal of this website is to provide a
        centralized location for all course-related information at CNU, merging
        data from all these sources into a single, beautiful website that meets
        today's Internet standards.
      </p>
      <p>
        CNU has done a great job with their registration services. There are no
        glaring issues that exist that constantly cause problems for students.
        The systems that power these sites are clearly well-kept, and the school
        is to be commended for this. OpenCourse is not here to replace or to "fix"
        any problems whatsoever. The goal of the project is to make small changes,
        present data in a more user-friendly way, and to offer additional methods
        of browsing and planning.
      </p>
      <p>
        With this in mind, a lot of careful development has been done to ensure
        that these two distinct systems stay seperate. This website does not
        offer <strong>any</strong> registration services nor does it attempt to
        subvert or replace any functionality of CNU Live. Because data is
        automatically scraped from various sources to populate this website, it
        could be temporarily out of date at any time. Furthermore, there's no
        budget for this project; everything that you see is volunteer work.
        There is always the possibility that something breaks and isn't noticed.
        Please use this resource for it's intended purpose: planning, researching,
        and as a supplement to official University systems. Do not entrust your
        semester to any one website, ever.

        Security is one of the most important goals of this project. Not all
        people are concerned about the privacy of their schedule information,
        but for those who are it's been made a priority. Here are some details
        of what has been done to protect personal information:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>No accounts are created on this site.</strong> When you login
          with your CNU account, you are using Google's OAuth systems which give
          information about your account, like your email address, to the site
          but never your password or any other personal information from CNU Live.
          Logging in with your CNU account to this site does not give it access
          to act on your behalf in any way.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>The site is encrypted with an industry-standard certificate.</strong>
          The lock icon in the upper left-hand corner of your URL bar will confirm
          that this site is using SSL/TLS to restrict visibility to you and only
          you. The information that you enter on this site and any data you get
          back is unreadable even to eavesdroppers. The certificate used has an
          <a href="https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/analyze.html?d=opencourseproject.com&s=104.18.51.176">A rating on SSL Labs</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Any personal information provided by API requires a secret key.</strong>
          If you're a developer using the <a href="/api/">API</a>, you will already
          know that aside from general, open data (such as course listings, term
          details, professor scores, etc.), a private and unique key is required
          to read or write. For the non-developer, this means that even at the
          most barebones level of data retrieval, your schedules are visible only
          to your account and cannot be accessed through the database without
          your explicit permission.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>The source code is open.</strong> Aside from private keys used
          to communicate with third-parties such as Google and Facebook, none of
          the code that runs this website is proprietary. If you come across a
          vulnerability or a problem in the code that has security implications,
          please <a href="mailto:ad@mfendley.com" target="_top">email me</a>.
        </li>
      </ul>

    </div>
    <div class="panel-body">
      <p>
        Though the goal of this project focuses completely on CNU, the framework
        that has been created could apply to many universities. In order to
        populate the site with information from a different source, the custom
        management commands would need to be rewired to fetch from another location.
        Some other discrepancies could exist in how courses are labled, but a lot
        of the work is written to be generic.
